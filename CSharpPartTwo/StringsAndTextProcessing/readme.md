1.	Describe the strings in C#. What is typical for the string data type? Describe the most important methods of the String class.
2.	Write a program that reads a string, reverses it and prints the result at the console.
Example: "sample"  "elpmas".
3.	Write a program to check if in a given expression the brackets are put correctly.
Example of correct expression: ((a+b)/5-d).
Example of incorrect expression: )(a+b)).
4.	Write a program that finds how many times a substring is contained in a given text (perform case insensitive search).
		Example: The target substring is "in". The text is as follows:
	The result is: 9.
5.	You are given a text. Write a program that changes the text in all regions surrounded by the tags <upcase> and </upcase> to uppercase. The tags cannot be nested. Example:
		The expected result:
6.	Write a program that reads from the console a string of maximum 20 characters. If the length of the string is less than 20, the rest of the characters should be filled with '*'. Print the result string into the console.
7.	Write a program that encodes and decodes a string using given encryption key (cipher). The key consists of a sequence of characters. The encoding/decoding is done by performing XOR (exclusive or) operation over the first letter of the string with the first of the key, the second – with the second, etc. When the last key character is reached, the next is the first.
8.	Write a program that extracts from a given text all sentences containing given word.
		Example: The word is "in". The text is:
		The expected result is:
		Consider that the sentences are separated by "." and the words – by non-letter symbols.
